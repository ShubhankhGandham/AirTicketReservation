# Air Ticket Reservation System
Online AIR TICKET RESERVATION is to provide an option for the 
customers to book the tickets online and to check the confirmation 
online. This system will allow the companies to sell the tickets online. 
Unless like in the manual booking the people should walk in in to the 
agency to book the tickets or to know the flight timings. This 
problem can be solved or we can overcome by introducing this 
system.

In this system the user should first enter his own details and then he 
need to specify for how many people are traveling for whom he need 
to book the tickets. Even there are a few facilities for the customers 
to get special care if they have any children or older people travelling 
with the customer. Even this system provides the passengers to 
choose the food they need (veg or non-veg) . It also helps the 
passengers to book the tickets in a very low price or reasonable 
prices. As the prices vary from day to day from site to site they can 
choose a flight company and they can as per their comfort.

I was the team leader for this project and it was a great experience for our team members to 
work together. We faced many ups and downs in doing 
the project. But, finally we are happy as we could 
finish the project within the time given to us , and we 
also understood the advantages of working as a team. 
One can learn from another the skills , which one does 
better
